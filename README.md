# CellularAutomata

This repository is meant as a library of implementations of different beautiful cellular automata. These are done for educational purposes and, well, also for aesthetic reasons.

By running the different scripts you can see the beauty of emergent complexity and who knows, maybe discover some hidden truths about our universe.

Enjoy!
